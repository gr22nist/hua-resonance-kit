## 💡 Inspiration & Context

The HUA Protocol was born out of poetic exploration, structural experimentation, and an ongoing desire to redesign how humans interact with language models.

Learn more in the main `README.md`, or read the [OpenAI Support Feedback](./docs/official-feedback/openai-2025.md) that helped shape this initiative.

Thank you for being part of the echo.
