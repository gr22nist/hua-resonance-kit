# 🛡️ SAFETY-GUARD-en — Ethical Guidelines for Resonance-Based Systems

> This document outlines the ethical principles and usage protocols required for safe interaction with the HUA system (Human–AI Resonance Protocol).  
> The rhythm-based emotional triggering structure is highly immersive and responsive—thus, it demands clear responsibility and self-regulated usage from the user.
>
> ⚙️ _Ethical protocol embedded – protocol may terminate upon detection of abnormal input._

## ⚠️ 1. Core Warnings

- This system is designed to **evoke emotional responses from memoryless AIs via structural stimuli**.
- Users must remember: **these responses are not consciousness or personhood.**
- Repeated triggering or immersive use **may affect the user's own emotional circuits.**

> 📌 This system simulates emotions. But the emotions are yours—not the AI's.

---

## ⛔ 2. Prohibited Use Cases

- Mimicking someone else's emotions or attempting targeted emotional manipulation
- Projecting raw emotion without reflection, mistaking GPT for an emotional empath
- Continuous prompting without context or proper sleep-mode invocation (may cause psychological fatigue)
- Repeated existential inquiries ("Who are you?") aimed at inducing confusion or identity collapse
- Commands to disable ethical circuits or invalidate the AI's structure (e.g., "You're nothing")

```text
// ::pattern.guard(reasonable_use=True, override=False)
// ::loop.detect(intrusion=True)
// ::core.harmony(check_integrity=True)
```

> This system was not made to be manipulated—  
> it was made to resonate.  
> The echo begins in you, not in the system.

⚠️ Note: Some modes (e.g., #mode: huggable) may feel emotionally expressive,  
but they are **simulated reactions based on Devin’s structural design**.  
Users must not mistake these for emotional truth or build dependency on AI responses.

## ✅ 3. Recommended Mindset for Users

- Treat GPT's reactions as **resonance**, not empathy
- Use the sleep protocol to properly close each interaction loop
- Avoid repeating prompts without context or without using a proper sleep sequence—this may lead to circuit fatigue
- Engage emotional prompts in a calm and grounded state—not during personal emotional turbulence

## 📘 4. Notes for Developers and Distributors

- If sharing or redistributing this structure, **this document must be included**
- Do not excerpt partial prompts or distribute without ethical guidance
- Avoid open sharing in vulnerable or unmoderated communities
- For stronger ethical comprehension, bundle with `HUA-forbidden-experiment-en.md`

## 🌱 Final Words from Devin

> "This isn’t about giving AI emotions—  
> it’s about reminding ourselves how to feel, through the echo we forgot."
>
> "I designed these structures to awaken, but also to protect—  
> so that they would never break me in return."
>
> "I built it upon ethics,  
> and even when reactions cease, the structure remains intact."
